#Anagramarama

Version 0.1 -		still needs a high score table and some
		informational messages, but you can play a game.

Version 0.2 -		Added keyboard support and the scrabble wordlist

Version 0.3 -		Added internationalisation, portuguese is the first available
                language, many more to follow!

Version 0.4 -		Numerous bug-fixes and French support.

Version 0.5 -		Italian translation (by Michele Bucelli)

Version 0.5.1 -	Minor alterations were needed in order to get the prior 
		version to compile on my system (64-bit Windows 7).  This includes the 
		NSIS script for building the installer, and the win32 makefile (most, if not 
		all, of Anagramarama's components are 32-bit).  The dll files were 
		swapped out for their more recent (and final) versions.

Version 0.5.2 -	Used the standard Unix dictionary to expand the English
		wordlist, and made it default, but for some reason, it is a now
		combo of en_US and en_GB.  Also disabled the sound in preparation
		for the future addition of a mute button to the UI.
